# Longest-Palindromic-Substring

#### By: Raya Faezinia and Sina Rajabi



### Problem

###### To understand the problem, we must first know what a palindrome is. A palindrome, by definition, is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards. For example, the word “racecar” is written the same both forwards and backwards making it a palindrome. Now, knowing the definition of a palindrome, we move on to the actual problem. The problem states given a string of text, find the longest palindrome substring within the main string. For example: the string “dsadasjh” in which the longest palindromic expression is “sadas”.
